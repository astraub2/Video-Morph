This purpose of this project is to use OpenCV to distort videos in C++ and then use OpenMP to parallelize the serial code.

This program only works on linux. If you do not have linux, a virtual machine running linux is needed. 

The user will need to download openCV. Here is a tutorial: https://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/
Follow these steps to ensure OpenCV is installed correctly.
I recommend using the demo file on the site, it's very helpful.

Available commands for the program are:
invert, self_overlay, darken, watermark, bw, negative, blur

To run the program:

make clean
make all

//to run serial implementation
./video-write <video filename> <command> -serial

//to run serial implementation for watermark distortion
./video-write <video filename> <command> -serial <watermark image file name>

//to run parallel implementation
./video-write <video filename> <command> -serial

//to run parallel implementation for watermark distortion
./video-write <video filename> <command> -parallel <watermark image file name>
