Hey guys, this document is unofficial and for communication purposes
In this folder is eerything you need to get started.
First, some dependencies:
CMake installed

Next, you will need openCV on your machine. 

If you have linux, your in luck!
I found  perfect tutorial to get you started:
    https://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/
Follow these steps to ensure OpenCV is installed correctly.
I recomend using the demo file on the site, it's very helpful.

If your on a Mac, please let the team know your installation steps for 
documentation purposes.
A warning, I spent almost 6 hours installing openCV on my machine. The
problem was I had not installed all of the dependency files. Read openCV's
installation guides thouroughly to ensure you have installed all the right libraries.

Next, once you have done a demo of openCV and are confident it is running properly,
please run the following command 
to generate the build files and run warp_serial:
    cmake . && make
PS do this from the 431_parallel_group_project folder
Finally, run the generated program. It will tell you the syntax information.


PS I have 15 hours logged trying to get this to run, It might take a while 
to get started.
