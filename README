This purpose of this project is to use OpenCV to distort videos in C++ and then use OpenMP to parallelize the serial code.

This program only works on linux. If you do not have linux, a virtual machine running linux is needed. 

The user will need to download openCV. Here is a tutorial: https://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/
Follow these steps to ensure OpenCV is installed correctly.
I recommend using the demo file on the site, it's very helpful.

The repo includes the following files:
	5 avi files for video test (bird.avi, cbw3.avi, color.AVI, drop.avi, flame.avi)
	watermark.jpg (a test image for the watermark filter)
	Makefile
	warp_serial.cpp (our serial implementation of the project)
	warp-video.cpp (both serial and parallel implementation of the project)
	.gitignore (to ignore .DS_Store)
	A PDF for our project report
	This README

Available commands for the program are:
invert, self_overlay, darken, watermark, bw, negative, blur

To run the program:

make clean
make all

//to run serial implementation
./video-write <video filename> <command> -serial

//to run serial implementation for watermark distortion
./video-write <video filename> <command> -serial <watermark image file name>

//to run parallel implementation
./video-write <video filename> <command> -serial

//to run parallel implementation for watermark distortion
./video-write <video filename> <command> -parallel <watermark image file name>
